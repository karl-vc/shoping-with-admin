<p>Along with FAQ and Contact pages, the About Us page is one of the first supporting pages you'll likely create for your website, regardless of the industry you're in.

They may go by different labels—“About”, “Story”, “Mission”—but these types of pages generally serve the same key purpose: to be the go-to page for a brand to say, “This is who we are.”

When a visitor wants to learn more about you or your business, it's the page they'll look for.

Unfortunately, About Us pages are too often treated as an obligation rather than the valuable opportunity they are to connect with your customers by selling your story, your vision, your mission, and what makes you, YOU.

What an About Us page is really for
The problem with many About Us pages is they’re an afterthought—a link buried in the footer of a website that leads to a few hastily written paragraphs about a company.

What an About Us page should be is a goal-oriented sales page, one that focuses on highlighting the biggest selling points of your story and brand, making a strong impression on curious customers.

If anyone wants to quickly understand your brand, your About Us page should be the single link you send them.

In contrast to a landing page, your About Us page is the ideal place to accommodate a number of objectives:

Communicate the story of your business and why you started it.
Describe the customers or the cause that your business serves.
Explain your business model or how your products are made.
Put a face to your business, featuring the founders or the people on your team.
Incorporate persuasive content (e.g. an explainer video, data visualizations, links to blog posts) that might otherwise clutter your homepage.
In short, your About Us page is a home for your founding story, a place to show off your business wins, and a sales page that answers the most pressing question new customers have about your business outside why they should buy its products:
